# Overview

This package is a dependable thread pool package for chez scheme. I hacked chez-a-sync(https://github.com/ChrisVine/chez-a-sync) and simplified it. And my purpose is making this library easily imported into other code.

This package is published with Akku(https://akkuscm.org/), which is a language package manager for Scheme. 

This package has been tested with Chez Scheme versions 9.4 and 9.5.


# Requirement 

This package uses chez scheme's FFI to call up the pipe() and poll()
system calls.  It therefore requires a UNIX-like operating system to
function correctly.  It has been tested with linux and should work on
the BSDs and on Mac OS X. If using OS X, the glibtool package will be
required.

This package also requires chez scheme to have been compiled with the
--threads option.
